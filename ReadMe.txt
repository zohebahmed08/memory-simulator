Implementation Details

I.	Two Separate doubly link list have been used to keep the record of the holes and the memory allocated to the processes.

II.	The algorithm begins by partitioning the 64 k memory in the form of alternative holes and processes to depict a realistic scenario.

III.	Then the program enters a loop in which 10,000 + allocations and de-allocations alternate depending on the remainder on a value generated by rand function.

IV.	In the allocate memory function a process of random size is generated and then a respective hole is searched in the holes list. 

V.	If a match is found depending on the selection algorithm used the hole is removed or shrunk from the holes list and a new process is inserted into the process link list.

VI.	And when the de-allocate memory function is called a process is deleted from the holes list based on a random selection and the memory freed is inserted into the holes list.

VII.	If two holes are found to be consecutive then they are merged together.
